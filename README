Pail GUI
The interface for and by the people

What is it?
Pail is a Java swing Graphical User Interface designed specifically for bukkit.

Why is it different?
Pail stands apart from other server GUIs in several ways.
Pail is written as a plugin, meaning the same, simple drag-and-drop install server owners have come to know.
Pail uses pure Java and no external libraries, eliminating the need for any dependencies.
Pail is designed for bukkit servers, allowing more control than any vanilla server GUI.
Pail is extensible! Other plugins can hook into Pail to add their own interfaces, creating a single place for server admins to manage their server and players.
Pail is completely cross-platform.
What can other plugins do?

Pail opens up many opportunities for plugin developers to take advantage of. Plugins can be written solely to add functionality to Pail, or Pail support can be integrated easily into existing plugins. Just imagine being able to edit your permissions groups, view server performance, or manage your world's economy all from a single interface.

=================
For Developers:
You can start developing for Pail now! The API currently consists of one simple method for adding components to the interface. To add a tab for your plugin to the Pail GUI, pass the title of your plugin's tab and the JPanel containing your interface to:

PluginManager pm = this.getServer().getPluginManager();
((Pail)pm.getPlugin("Pail")).loadInterfaceComponent("Title", new JPanel());

Installation:
Just drop Pail.jar into your plugins folder. That's it!
